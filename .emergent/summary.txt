The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive frontend application for Arka, comprising a main landing page and a separate 10-slide presentation. Initial development focused on establishing a multi-page structure with mock data, adhering to a dark, high-contrast theme ( accent). Iterative feedback from the user led to significant design refinements, including adjusting image opacity, alternating section backgrounds (white/anthracite), implementing small border-radii, adding numerous animations (fade-in, slide-in, hover, scroll invitation), and introducing professional illustrations using . The core architecture utilizes React, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS. The last actions involved fixing layout issues on a presentation slide and creating new documentation and legal pages, with routing pending.
